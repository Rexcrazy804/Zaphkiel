## What the heck is going on here?

- hjem + [hjem-impure](https://github.com/Rexcrazy804/hjem-impure) over home manager
- Adorable kurukurubar complimented by the fabulous kurukurulock

## Exported packages

The following packages are exported by this flake:

| package | description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| kurukurubar (stable)| adorable bar to spin the kuru kuru |
| kurukurubar-unstable | latest version, uses master version of qs |
| kokCursor | A cute kokomi XCursor |
| xvim | My neovim configuration using [mnw](https://github.com/Gerg-L/mnw). provides `.default` and `.minimal`|
| mpv | My mpv configuration with [anime4k](https://github.com/bloc97/Anime4K) shaders baked in |
| librebarcode | The [librebarcode](https://graphicore.github.io/librebarcode/) font |

you may run any of the above with the following command (ofc you can't run a
cursor, `nix build` it instead) replacing `nixvim` with your desired package

```bash
nix run github:Rexcrazy804/Zaphkiel#nixvim
```

<details>
<summary><h3>kurkurubar stable or unstable</h3></summary>

<ins>kurkurubar (stable)</ins>

- uses nixpkgs version of quickshell (v0.2.0)
- ~uses [this revision](https://github.com/Rexcrazy804/Zaphkiel/tree/cc6d5cf12ae824e6945cc2599a2650d5fe054ffe) of Zaphkiel dots (last version that is compatible with v0.1.0)~
- ^ currently tracks master branch, not diverged yet
- package updated every major tagged release of quickshell

<ins>kurkurubar-unstable</ins>

- follows Zaphkiel master branch HEAD
- uses untagged master revisions of quickshell
- by default uses my patched version of qs (for finger print unlock in greetd)
- requires quickshell to be built from source

For more information on both see the [internal overlay](pkgs/overlays/internal.nix)

## Exported modules

Well there is only one module that is exported rn,
and that is *DRUM ROLL* kurukuruDM!!!
now available as `nixosModules.kurukuruDM` :D

> if you run into errors please open an issue,
> since I don't use the flake exported module
> there is a chance for the exported module being broken

## Acknowledgement

Firstly, I have to thank [sioodmy](https://github.com/sioodmy)
for being the inspiration to ditch home manager and writing wrappers myself.
I had known of wrappers before, but if it weren't for him,
I wouldn't have heard of `pkgs.symlinkJoin` :D

I also extend my gratitude to [NotAShelf](https://github.com/NotAShelf)
for developing the hjem nixos module. And also for his welcome criticism
on some of the dumb nix code I've written.

I have to thank both the AnAnimeGameLauncher and Hyprland discord communities
for all the help I've received and continue to receive.

Lastly, I have to thank the nix community for their efforts in
[home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)
and [nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim).
Both of which have been great resources throughout my early adventures in nix.
