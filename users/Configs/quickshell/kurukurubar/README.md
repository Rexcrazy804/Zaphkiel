Designed in acordance to google's material 3 guidelines, you can generate
colors from your wallpaper using [matugen](https://github.com/InioX/matugen)
using [this template](../../../../nixosModules/external/matugen/templates/quickshell-colors.qml)
> If you'd like to reserve space for the top bar OR cool particle effect on mousemovement see the comment(s) in [shell.qml](shell.qml)

### Depencencies
- quickshell
- material-symbols
- nerdfonts
- qtmultimedia (prolly already installed on your system)
- powerprofilesdaemon (optional)
- brightnessctl (optional)

### Known Issues
- `org.Hyprland.style is not installed`: see [#21](https://github.com/Rexcrazy804/Zaphkiel/issues/21#issuecomment-2906546939)
- empty networktab: currently unimplemented waiting for qs to provide a service. For the time being you can use `nm-applet`
- empty face icon in greeter: symlink an image (of any image type) to ~/.face.icon

This rice is exposed as a package in the toplevel flake and can be used to run the rice as follows
```
nix run gitub:Rexcrazy804/Zaphkiel#quickshell
